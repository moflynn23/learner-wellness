### 4. Deployment
- demonstrate how to deploy project
- record to self and others of how to deploy and use our software
- detailed list of deployment steps
- heroku
- elephantsql
- cloudinary

## Heroku
- Activate your Heroku Student Pack
- Get the student offer‚Äù
- Heroku dashboard
- Account settings
- Billings
- Subscribe to Eco
- Eco dyno
- Your Eco dyno subscription is now active
- DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC key has a value of 1
- pip3 to install webserver gunicorn~=20.1
- Procfile: add a command using gunicorn and codestar wsgi: web: gunicorn codestar.wsgi
- DEBUG constant to False
- Heroku dashboard: go to your app. Click on the Deploy tab
- Reveal Config Vars in the Settings
- DATABASE_URL = add the value of the ElephantSQL URL

 ## Elephant SQL
- ElephantSQL is a PostgreSQL database hosting service that uses several cloud-hosted platforms
- Log into ElephantSQL to access your dashboard
- Create New Instance.
- Tiny Turtle plan
- Select a data centre near you
- Create instance
- Click on your newly named instance
- Click on STATS.
- Verify the version of PostgreSQL is 12 or higher
- Create a file named env.py,
- .gitignore file: add env.py
- os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "<your-database-URL>")
- pip3 install dj-database-url~=0.5 psycopg2~=2.9, pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
- settings.py: import os; import dj_database_url if os.path.isfile('env.py'):     import env
- python3 manage.py createsuperuser

## Cloudinary
- A persistent file store
- Cloudinary is an API, so we will need an API key to connect the Django project to it securely
- pip3 install cloudinary~=1.36.0 dj3-cloudinary-storage~=0.0.6 urllib3~=1.26.15
- pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
- Sign up to Cloudinary
- env.py: os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "<URL copied from Cloudinary in last step>")
- settings.py: INSTALLED_APPS
- Update the app to use Cloudinary
- import the CloudinaryField from the cloudinary/models.py
- python3 manage.py makemigrations
- python3 manage.py migrate

## Deployment with static files
- whitenoise server
- pip3 install whitenoise~=5.3.0
- pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
- settings.py: 'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',

### 5. Demonstrate Testing

Validator Testing
- Note: Regular HTML validators do not work well with DTL markup
- pip install django-html-validator
- It won't do anything until you chose how you want to use it and you also need to explicitly enable it with a setting.
- you have a choice of how you want to use this:
- As a middleware:
- In your unit tests (technically they're integration tests in Django)
- If you chose to set it up as a middleware and enable it accordingly it will run for every rendered template in the tests too. Not just when you run the server.
